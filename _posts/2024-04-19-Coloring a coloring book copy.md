Seed thought : Just like a page in a coloring book looks the most complete when the guiding numbers and lines have gotten covered themselves by the colors, I think in life too one feels complete and their most true self when they have discovered their own rules (i.e. boundaries) and are holding them above those of say, a friend, a manager, a company or the society. In such a frame with one's own guiding principles so refined that they can be held strong over everything else, nothing can intimidate them

The thought came to me at a social event with people painting on a canvas. The canvasses had a sketch of two mangoes on it for us to color.
