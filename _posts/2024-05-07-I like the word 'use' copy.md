I actually really like the word 'use'. I see it like an opportunity one shouldn't shy away from just because society only talks about it in a negative connotation. What one owns one can and should use. I only hear bells of progress. Using something you don't own is bad, yes. But then it can also be the case that for a while you owned something and it was perfectly fine for you to use it during that. So, keep reading the room and you'll know what you still own, can use and propel yourself, and actually how much you bring along the ones you could use tells the room what kind of a person you are.
