I am writing about an encounter that not only made me realize how disconnected from myself and lost I was at that time but also provided me with all the clues to become my sharpest self.
**Setting some context first** I had secured a job in the US again after eight months of being laid off from my tech job in NYC in April '23. While I now recognize this setback wasn't as significant as I initially perceived, losing my job in the US felt like the loss of my biggest achievement. My loss of income and the layoff-mood in the US tech market left me feeling powerless and like a lone sufferer because even though many got laid-off, it didn’t happen to most of my friends. I moved to India in August as there seemed no hope in the US and I wasn’t sleeping, eating or thinking well. Post my return I started working at a startup in Bangalore. I was going through the motions but I neither connected with my work nor with my team as I still was obsessed with finding a way to go back. My days were me working my job, preparing for interviews and applying for jobs. I did not socialize with anyone, let alone talking to a girl I am into. I was just not in that headspace. It indeed was an unbalanced life and therefore an unsustainable one. Come January I found myself a job in NYC again. After that, creating a profile on a matrimonial website was one of the ways I resumed my long paused normal life. So that’s all the context and now back to the meeting. The girl I met is a mental health therapist practicing in New York. I met her on a video call. After reading her self-written profile description, I revamped my own, because I got a hint that there is someone who will appreciate it. I still maintained my individuality in it to express not impress.

**An excerpt from my description on shaadi.com**
Not bragging ahead, just trying to paint an accurate picture of myself. I take interest in somebody's likes but I also don't question it pre-maturely. I like to do things at a brisk pace but I also don't rush conversation or meals. I prefer silent ambience but I will also use music to change my mood. I do my research thoroughly but I also don't try to optimize too much when there are a lot of options. I am fun-loving but I can also sacrifice the little joys when pursuing something important. I will not care how good your pictures look, what would matter to me is how good you feel about how they look. I regard loyalty over morality (partner in crime). Consequently, I might question you to check if you are being wise when spending, but I will never question you on discarding something that is definitely a liability. Of course, there's more but I hope you get the vibe
I hope you have an easy-going personality and a caring heart. I try to meet people half-way, and it would be amazing if you do too. We'll get along if you know what you're capable of and are also willing to build on it and grow from there

I am slightly proud of my confident & principled self, that manifests itself at least in private, for penning down a description so authentic & fresh that it got me the opportunity to meet this girl. Following our meeting, she messaged that she didn't feel a connection, and that admission stung and through that pain I found myself.

<span style="color: green;">How I was</span>

After mulling over it, I realized that my inability to connect with her had 2 root causes behind it.
Even during the meeting I had become acutely aware that I am doing poorly on the communication front. Yes, I was stressed and there were two interconnected reasons for it that turned out to be excellent clues to begin the process of my rediscovery with. In hindsight while talking to her I shamefully saw myself doing the waiting-to-speak instead of listening-to-understand thing, knowing full well how cringe it feels to the speaker. As a result, I wasn't connecting with her. At most, I was talking about something related to what she mentioned. I failed to sense or even ask about the emotions behind her connections with the things and people in her world which she talked passionately about. I now know that is a good way to know someone as exploring those connections will

**So what were these two reasons?**
I had not only forgotten how to connect with people but also stopped seeing any value in it (I was quite far down this slope)
Disconnected from a lot of things around me, I had lost touch with my true self resulting in not feeling comfortable with being my bold & outspoken self in front of anyone outside of family. Circumstances that also led to this were:
&nbsp;&nbsp;remote only work 
&nbsp;&nbsp;lived in a studio - regret taking that studio still
&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have moved to New Jersey and been around my fam like Indian ppl
&nbsp;&nbsp;lived in a small old building, only 8 apt in it and 0 young ppl in them to bump into
