I am writing about an encounter that not only made me realize how disconnected from myself and lost I was at that time but also provided me with all the clues to become my sharpest self.

**Setting some context first** I had secured a job in the US again after eight months of being laid off from my tech job in NYC in April '23. While I now recognize this setback wasn't as significant as I initially perceived, losing my job in the US felt like the loss of my biggest achievement. My loss of income and the layoff-mood in the US tech market left me feeling powerless and like a lone sufferer because even though many got laid-off, it didn’t happen to most of my friends. I moved to India in August as there seemed no hope in the US and I wasn’t sleeping, eating or thinking well. Post my return I started working at a startup in Bangalore. I was going through the motions but I neither connected with my work nor with my team as I still was obsessed with finding a way to go back. My days were me working my job, preparing for interviews and applying for jobs. I did not socialize with anyone, let alone talking to a girl I am into. I was just not in that headspace. It indeed was an unbalanced life and therefore an unsustainable one. Come January I found myself a job in NYC again. After that, creating a profile on a matrimonial website was one of the ways I resumed my long paused normal life. So that’s all the context and now back to the meeting. The girl I met is a mental health therapist practicing in New York. I met her on a video call. After reading her self-written profile description, I revamped my own, because I got a hint that there is someone who will appreciate it. I still maintained my individuality in it to express not impress.

**An excerpt of my description on shaadi.com**

Not bragging ahead, just trying to paint an accurate picture of myself. I take interest in somebody's likes but I also don't question it pre-maturely. I like to do things at a brisk pace but I also don't rush conversation or meals. I prefer silent ambience but I will also use music to change my mood. I do my research thoroughly but I also don't try to optimize too much when there are a lot of options. I am fun-loving but I can also sacrifice the little joys when pursuing something important. I will not care how good your pictures look, what would matter to me is how good you feel about how they look. I regard loyalty over morality (partner in crime). Consequently, I might question you to check if you are being wise when spending, but I will never question you on discarding something that is definitely a liability. Of course, there's more but I hope you get the vibe

I hope you have an easy-going personality and a caring heart. I try to meet people half-way, and it would be amazing if you do too. We'll get along if you know what you're capable of and are also willing to build on it and grow from there

I am slightly proud of my confident & principled self, that manifests itself at least in private, for penning down a description so authentic & fresh that it got me the opportunity to meet this girl. Following our meeting, she messaged that she didn't feel a connection, and that admission stung and through that pain I found myself.

<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px">**How I was**</span>

After mulling over it, I realized that my inability to connect with her had 2 root causes behind it.
Even during the meeting I had become acutely aware that I am doing poorly on the communication front. Yes, I was stressed and there were two interconnected reasons for it that turned out to be excellent clues to begin the process of my rediscovery with. In hindsight while talking to her I shamefully saw myself doing the waiting-to-speak instead of listening-to-understand thing, knowing full well how cringe it feels to the speaker. As a result, I wasn't connecting with her. At most, I was talking about something related to what she mentioned. I failed to sense or even ask about the emotions behind her connections with the things and people in her world. I have now realized that the strongest connections of that person form that person. Almost like, if one chooses to have no connection to anyone or anything, not even to themselves, they too can exist but we will never understand their existence. Therefore, to understand one's existence we must understand their connections.

**So what were these two reasons?**
I had not only forgotten how to connect with people but also stopped seeing any value in it (I was quite far down this slope)
Disconnected from a lot of things around me, I had lost touch with my true self resulting in not feeling comfortable with being my bold & outspoken self in front of anyone outside of family. Circumstances that also led to this were:

&nbsp;&nbsp;remote only work 

&nbsp;&nbsp;lived in a studio - regret taking that studio still

&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have moved to New Jersey and been around my fam like Indian ppl

&nbsp;&nbsp;lived in a small old building, only 8 apt in it and 0 young ppl in them to bump into

<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px">Moving forward, how I think I should operate as a man and the value I see in it</span>

(tldr)
I see the value of the man being a rock in a relationship
I see the value of the woman being the softer one in a relationship 

**Part One**

A side quest & a side note: While I was trying to figure out the missing ‘edge’ in my embodied self that was present in my described self, I also got the idea that this edge is the spark a woman is looking for. The edge with which the man carves his way in the world. A woman is looking for a man that is sharpening his edge constantly and utilizing the abundant freedom a man has that women have lesser of in this society but possibly only preferentially because she doesn’t want to waste her time saying polite no(s) to the meaningless approaches towards her. Pardon me, I digress. So, I then wanted to know why women naturally look for this? Is there more value to it? Is there an element of fun to it ?



**So, I started with the two clues below to find out the value they bring along with a thrill/spark** :
1. why does the push/pull feel exciting? there must be something valuable about this seemingly dark play. 
2. there’s definitely something about winning someone over, AKA owning them/dominating them

**About push & pull**: I think we all might have experienced that the longer one stays in the comfort of their home the more they regress towards naivety. So if one doesn’t have consistent practice of facing a little darkness, they will lose their sharpness. They will then either not realize it when others are playing them or won’t have the tact to counter it and will lose their cool. So the value in getting played by your partner is in the practice one gets in keeping their composure when being poked. Only a partner can do this in a sly yet not-really-hurting way because you trust them without reservation. This is an exclusive luxury as they own you and you own them. 

**A connection to the therapist personality in all of us**  - how a good therapist or a wise & compassionate friend feels like home because they are willing to understand us and guide us, and how one can come as a partner in someone’s life and if they have a therapist like vibe (esp the man) - the other will find a home in them, conversely, one can also come as a therapist, that is when one starts dating someone, and become a partner because the other will seem to have found a home in them. Of course, if it is only one-sided this is not sustainable, but if the role can alternate or even be split 70-30 then it’s a beautiful thing.

Diving into this further, the vibe a man can have, **because he’s naturally gifted to be less emotional**, is solemn and exuding an assurance that no matter what's wrong, he will understand, accept and guide and be able to protect those under him. Congruent to a therapist’s client, a woman in her dating phase, in turn, senses this and slowly reveals more about themselves, while continuously gauging how well the man is understanding her and if or now he is able to navigate her towards being better. This is how two strangers can gradually find a home in each other
Keeping the above two in mind, one might understand why men are hard-wired to be less emotional and naturally more suited to act as a rock (emotionally detached) in a relationship.

**Combining all of the above**: I discerned how to operate as a man (works just as well for a woman when it comes to dealing with the world outside their home). It goes like - other than your work & relationship, as they financially & emotionally support you and give you meaning (because responsibility = meaning) don’t take anything else seriously. What/who you don't take seriously cannot intimidate you. It will not stay on your mind, nor bother you, nor evoke a reaction from you. 

Even in work and relationships, don’t take what the people express seriously. If it is a compliment, be thankful, don’t stay in the euphoria for long at all. If it is a valid criticism, work on it, don’t feel bad about it. Even if the words don’t convey enough may be because of too much expression, tease out what they mean and focus on that alone so that you can keep things running smoothly.




**Part Two**

I also realized the importance of a woman being the more emotional one in a relationship 

    1. A woman using her emotions will examine a man - if the man starts to react instead of responding when she expresses any emotion that tells her that he got intimidated by her emotions then he has then failed her test
    
    2. Her emotions will also give away the ways a man must improve. Whenever there’s even a slight cringe in her mind about something the man said or did, she is disapproving of that vibe - and the man’s vibe requires a little fine tuning

    3. If he passes her tests and wins her over, she’d accept him and once in a relationship her emotions will empower the man to strive to be better and do more in his life

    4. Men or really anybody stays focussed and efficient at their work when they act devoid of emotions, and so when a man comes home a woman’s emotions will fill this void of his - easing and relaxing the man and inviting him to share his emotions. Now is the time. Isn’t it amazing the complete flip one has to make when work ends and home starts. The emotions and expressions elevate each other above anything in the world and make each other feel like a god and a goddess as they should.

Another time when a man needs a woman is whenever the man is acting as if something/someone is controlling, attracting or intimidating him. In that state, the man is definitely not himself and he’s not going to make wise decisions as his own wisdom is inaccessible to him. At this time his woman should know enough tact to wisen him up. A man’s nature as we know is to believe a woman, especially his woman, so just by her acting a little disagreeable and outwitting him or by asking some cutting questions she can be a mirror to her man showing him how different he is behaving from his true self and knock him back to his senses. 

In closing, a sincere thank you to that girl who unlocked the man in me. Unlocked people unlock people. All I had to do was listen. I’m still listening, so... lmk.
