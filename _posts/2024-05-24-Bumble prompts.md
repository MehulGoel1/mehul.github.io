**> Favorite fact**: we are nothing more or less than what we choose to reveal.

**> What gets me out of bed every morning**: the need to do more than the need to say it.

**> Dating me is like**:  being in an apartment with two rooms. An uncomfortable one with bright white lights, & a comfortable, with dim yellow lights. One’s for growing, the other for resting. In one you will be enlightened with visions, you just have to follow, the other room, you will brighten, with your colorful emotions. In one, you will feel a challenge & you might feel like you are the darkest thing, in the other nothing will be a challenge, you can be the brightest thing, glowing with your passions, while my darkness protects you. The best part? you wouldn’t have to change the rooms yourself, whenever I see you stagnating or not being yourself I will change it for you.

**> Quickest way to my heart**: to argue with me. I see girls capable of doing that as a kitten roaring. So adorable.

**> The key to my heart is**: to teach me something. Is there anything more romantic than that?

**> Together, we could**: balance the emotionless goal-driven behavior at work with expressive and inspired activities thereafter.

**> This year, I really want to**: find someone who kick me out of bed every morning to make mo' money 'cz she wants new earrings.

**> All I ask is that you**: are a curious one

**> My love language**: is to put a moisturizer on you when I'd put it on myself because I think we rarely are able to overcome the inertia of our day to do it for ourselves even though we know we should. So if it is a task that will benefit us both, that is suddenly a worthy enough to pause my day for.
