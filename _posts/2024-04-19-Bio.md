Hey, I am interested in being roommates with you guys. I have been touring the Herald towers to see some rooms available and every time I love it more. Below is a bit about me:

I'm a 27 yr old male working in Midtown. I go to work 5 days a week. I have been working in the city since May '22 after graduating from Columbia University. I am clean and courteous. I’ll keep area clean and wouldn’t mind cleaning them either. With the right tools, it rarely takes more than 5-10 mins. I keep the volume levels low or wear my earphones. I generally don't play music while showering either beacuse showering is like meditation to me. More on this below.

I rarely cook, even if I do it just rice. I won't have people visiting and staying. I am not into staying out too late (nothing good happens after 2am anyways). Not much into clubbing or drinking. I usually go out for open mics, improv shows, brunches, social club events or just for people watching of course.

Love these - surprises, stoicism, short stories, self-awareness, strangers
Not these - conformity, conceit, complaining

I blog too. 

**Why I really put anti-slip mats in the shower**
I had put anti-slip mats so that people don’t slip in the shower (the college kids that I was living with). They asked me why, I gave them that reason. But today morning I realized of this more meaningful reason that I’d like to share

I think taking a shower is like meditation. Meditation is comparable to letting go of the small things that bother you go and once you do that you automatically are listening to the higher self. One needs to take one self out of the way to listen to the higher self who is very much within them only quieter because it is so empowered that it does not need to speak loudly. This is probably why, to listen to one’s higher self one has to quiet their life absolutely which is what meditation is.

So, coming back to the ‘losing oneself’ thought, one can only lose oneself when they feel secure enough, or nothing is attracting (or distracting) them. A shower is slippery, equivalent to insecurity, so with anti-slip mats one would feel secure and be able to “lose themselves”, subsequently, listen to their higher self
