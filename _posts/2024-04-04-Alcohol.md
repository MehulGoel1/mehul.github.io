**Ofc I am joking, or am I?*

To complete the thought, it goes like: Thank God for alcohol. It cleans so well. Cleans them right off my path. 

**A Theory**
Why do we feel our needs amplified or kind of feel like we got an excuse to act on them? I think the same would be the case if I told you that you're dying tomorrow. So if that's the trigger for us to let ourselves be in control of our needs then maybe our needs amplified suggest that our mind thinks that we are dying. And dying we very well maybe because of the poison that alcohol is. Get it?

Still wanna live like there's no tomorrow?

Anyhow, here I want to write about how one day when I woke up after getting a drink the night before, I realized how potent of a thing alcohol is. 

**The Story**

(still writing)
